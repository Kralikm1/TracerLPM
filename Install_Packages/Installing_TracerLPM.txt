D. INSTALLING

Installing TracerLPM
------------------

Note that if the software is to be installed on a server system, 
the person installing the software generally must have administrator 
rights.

Before TracerLPM can be installed, it is imperative to determine the version
of Excel installed on the user's machine. For 64-bit versions of Excel 2010,
users should download TracerLPM_x64.msi to their machine. For 32-bit versions
of Excel 2007 and 2010, users should download TracerLPM_x32.msi.

To install the software, double-click TracerLPM_x32.msi or TracerLPM_x64.msi
to execute the installation program and follow the directions on the screen.
By default, the software is installed in the directory
C:\Program Files\USGS\TracerLPM.  This is the recommended installation 
directory, but you may use other directories or disk drives.


TracerLPM directory structure
---------------------------

The following directory structure will be created (the contents of each
directory are shown to the right):

   TracerLPM              file TracerLPM_V_1_0.xlsm;
     `-----doc            documentation files 
     `-----examples       examples from user guide

E. RUNNING THE SOFTWARE

To run the software, users can open the TracerLPM_V_1_0.xlsm workbook and choose to 
enable macros. This will cause the program to automatically check that the Excel
add-in, TracerLPM_functions_64_v_1.xll or TracerLPM_functions_32_v_1.xll, has
been installed correctly. The program will also check to see if the Sover add-in
is also installed.

It is recommended that users save any altered versions of TracerLPM separately
from the original file, TracerLPM_V_1_0.xlsm, to prevent accidental overwrite.

E. UNINSTALLING

To uninstall TracerLPM, double-click TracerLPM_x32.msi or TracerLPM_x64.msi
and follow the directions on the screen. Alternatively, the program can be
unistalled from the Control Panel of the windows operating system and selecting
to uninstall TracerLPM from the list of programs.
